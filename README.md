Project Code name: Jarvis :D

This project serves as a one stop dashboard for most of the smart home devices ranging from switches, thermostats etc. 
The main motive of this project is to reuse those old smart phones that I have accumulated over the years. This could 
 evolve in many directions, few of which are
  1. A standard home automation mobile based dashboard that can aggregate multiple smart home devices that we commonly use on a daily basis
  2. It could also evolve to have a push to speak functionality to connect to open source  virtual assistants 
 (the likes of [Lucida](http://lucida.ai/), [Jasper](https://jasperproject.github.io/), [Mycroft](https://github.com/MycroftAI) etc.)
 
Requirements
============
 
 1. A running [ouimeaux](https://ouimeaux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)server for managing belkin switches. This is currently running on a
  raspberry pi for my setup.
